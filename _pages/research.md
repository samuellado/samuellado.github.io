<summary>Abstract</summary>
We study the potential effect of the declaration of the state of emergency, the beginning and end of the stay-at-home orders, and the one-off Economic Impact Payments on food hardship in the US during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. We use daily data from Google Trends for the search term “foodbank” and document the development of a hunger crisis, as indicated by the number of individuals who need to locate a food pantry through the internet. The demand for charitable food handouts begins to decrease once families start receiving the stimulus payments, but the biggest fall comes when economic activity resumes after the lifting of the lockdown orders. Our estimates indicate that the increased need for emergency help among vulnerable families lasted for at least 10 weeks during the first wave of the pandemic, and we argue that real-time data can be useful in predicting such urgency.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
The COVID-19 pandemic has completely changed the need for internet connectivity and technologicaldevices across the population, but especially among school-aged children. For alarge proportion of pupils,access to a connected computer nowadays makes the difference between being able to keep up with theireducational development and falling badly behind. This paper provides a detailed account of the digitallydeprived children inEurope, according to the latest available wave of the European Union–Statistics onIncome and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). We find that 5.4% of school-aged children in Europe aredigitally deprived and that differences are large across countries. Children that cohabit with low-educatedparents, in poverty or in severe material deprivation are those most affected.
