## About me

I am a PhD student and research fellow at the Department of Economics at the Universitat de Girona working under the supervision of [Sara Ayllón](http://www.saraayllon.eu/). In January 2024, I will join the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex as a visiting PhD student.

My research interests include poverty, inequality, applied microeconomics, public policy evaluation, labour economics, and public economics.
