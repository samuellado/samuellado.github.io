About me
======

Hi there! 

My name is Samuel, and I am an economist from Girona, Spain. I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Girona. I hold a MSc in Economic Analysis and two BSc degrees, one in Economics and the other in Business Administration and Management.

My research interests include poverty, inequality, applied microeconomics, public policy evaluation, labor economics, and public economics. If you share these interests or are interested in collaborating, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email at samuel.lado@udg.edu. You can also follow me on Twitter [@SamuelLF11](https://twitter.com/samuellf11), where I share updates about my work.
