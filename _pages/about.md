## About me

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Economics at the Universitat de Girona and a member of the research group [Economics of Inequality and Poverty Analysis (EQUALITAS)](https://equalitas.es/). I obtained my PhD at the Universitat de Girona in September 2025.

My research interests include poverty, inequality, applied microeconomics, public policy evaluation, labour economics and public economics. In my PhD thesis, I evaluated the impact of school-meal programmes on children's behaviour, health, and educational attainment, as well as on parental labour market outcomes. In doing so, I employed a wide range of quantitative methods, including meta-analytical techniques and causal inference methods.
