## About me

I am a PhD student and research fellow at the Department of Economics at the Universitat de Girona working under the supervision of [Sara Ayllón](http://www.saraayllon.eu/). I am also a member of the research group [Economics of Inequality and Poverty Analysis (EQUALITAS)](https://equalitas.es/). 

My research interests include poverty, inequality, applied microeconomics, public policy evaluation, labour economics and public economics. As part of my doctoral thesis, I am currently examining the impact of school meals on children's outcomes within the framework of the SCHOOL_MEALS project (further details are available on the project [webpage](http://www.saraayllon.eu/school_meals.html)). Additionally, I am investigating how free school meals influence parental labour market outcomes.

## Work in progress

The causal impact of school-meal programmes on children in developed economies: A meta-analysis (with Sara Ayllón).

- This paper is the first to meta-analyse the literature on the causal effects of school-meal programmes on children's behavioural, health and educational outcomes in developed countries, while addressing potential publication bias and heterogeneity between studies. We create a sample of 2,821 estimates from 42 studies and gather 59 aspects reflecting the context in which each estimate was obtained, including type of data, programme characteristics, student population, estimation method and publication quality, among others. We employ both linear and non-linear techniques to correct for publication bias, and we use Bayesian model averaging to study heterogeneous effects and address model uncertainty. The results are consistent with small publication bias --- with the exception of studies devoted to analysing test scores, which appear more selective when reporting results. Once publication bias is accounted for, we find that school-meal programmes in high-income economies have minimal impact on students' behaviour, health and education. Our heterogeneity analysis documents the fact that means-tested programmes and breakfast initiatives yield the greatest benefits for children's outcomes.

Universal free school meals and work incentives: lessons from England.

- This paper analyses the effects of a transition from a means-tested to a universal school-meal programme on parental labour market outcomes. Using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, we document that the introduction of the Universal Infant Free School Meals (UIFSM) policy — which provides free meals to children aged 4 to 7 — increased labour supply and reduced inactivity rates among mothers whose children were eligible for the programme, compared to when the same children were older, ineligible for universal free school meals by the programme's design, and therefore subject to means-tested school-meal subsidies. The effects are particularly pronounced for single mothers, those in households where the father is employed and those whose children received free school meals under the means-tested scheme before the introduction of the universal policy. In contrast, no significant effects are observed for fathers. Our findings suggest that the programme strengthens work incentives by removing the risk of losing access to free school meals when mothers enter employment.
