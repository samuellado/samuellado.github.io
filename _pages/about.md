## About me

I am a PhD student and research fellow at the Department of Economics at the Universitat de Girona working under the supervision of [Sara Ayll贸n](http://www.saraayllon.eu/). I am also a member of the research group [Economics of Inequality and Poverty Analysis (EQUALITAS)](https://equalitas.es/). In January 2025, I will join the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex as a visiting PhD student.

My research interests include poverty, inequality, applied microeconomics, public policy evaluation, labour economics, and public economics. As part of my doctoral thesis, I am currently examining the impact of school meals on children's outcomes within the framework of the SCHOOL_MEALS project (further details are available on the project [webpage](http://www.saraayllon.eu/school_meals.html)). Additionally, I am investigating how free school meals influence parental labour market outcomes.

## Work in progress

Subsidised school meals and children educational achievement and well-being: the case of Barcelona (with Sara Ayll贸n).
